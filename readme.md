# üß† CPU Simulator (MIPS-Inspired)

This project simulates a simplified CPU architecture in Python, modeling core components like the CPU, memory bus, and cache. It‚Äôs designed for educational and portfolio purposes ‚Äî not for real embedded hardware ‚Äî but it demonstrates key architectural concepts and system-level interactions.

## üöÄ Features

### CPU Core
- Program counter and register file
- Instruction parsing and execution
- HALT logic and control flow

### Memory Bus
- 1MB addressable memory
- Word-level read/write interface
- Input file support for memory initialization

### Cache System
- Direct-mapped cache with block-based storage
- Hit/miss detection and block replacement
- Write-back policy with flush support

### Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)

| Instruction | Operands         | Meaning                                      |
|-------------|------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `ADD`       | Rd, Rs, Rt       | Rd ‚Üê Rs + Rt                                 |
| `ADDI`      | Rt, Rs, immd     | Rt ‚Üê Rs + immd                               |
| `SUB`       | Rd, Rs, Rt       | Rd ‚Üê Rs - Rt                                 |
| `SUBI`      | Rd, Rs, immd     | Rd ‚Üê Rs - immd                               | 
| `SLT`       | Rd, Rs, Rt       | Rd ‚Üê (Rs < Rt) ? 1 : 0                       |
| `BNE`       | Rs, Rt, offset   | If Rs ‚â† Rt ‚Üí PC ‚Üê (PC + 4) + offset √ó 4      |
| `J`         | target           | PC ‚Üê target √ó 4                              |
| `JAL`       | target           | R7 ‚Üê PC + 4; PC ‚Üê target √ó 4                 |
| `LW`        | Rt, offset(Rs)   | Rt ‚Üê MEM[Rs + offset]                        |
| `SW`        | Rt, offset(Rs)   | MEM[Rs + offset] ‚Üê Rt                        |
| `CACHE`     | Code             | 0 = off, 1 = on, 2 = flush                   |
| `HALT`      | ;                | Terminate execution                          |

## üì¶ How It Works

1. **Input Files**
   - Instruction file: contains ISA commands
   - Memory file: initializes memory with address-value pairs

2. **Execution Flow**
   - CPU loads instructions and memory
   - Instructions are parsed and executed sequentially
   - Cache intercepts memory access and manages block-level data
   - Console output logs each stage of execution

3. **CLI Interface**
   - Uses `argparse` for command-line arguments
   - Optional: wrap with `click` for enhanced UX
